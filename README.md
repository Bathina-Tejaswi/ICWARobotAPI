## RobotAPI Solution
This repository contains two main components:
Web API (`RobotAPI`) - â€“ A RESTful API for managing robot commands
xUnit Tests (`RobotAPI.Tests`) - Designed to test the API's functionality using xUnit.

The Web API provides a set of endpoints for controlling a robot, and the xUnit tests ensure that the API functions correctly.

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
Visual Studio 
.NET SDK (Version 8.0 or higher)
xUnit for testing (can be installed through the solution)
Postman or any other API client (optional for testing endpoints manually)
